          <p>
            Perform Training is a science and data analytics-backed sports performance training system created
            to help you achieve your athletic potential.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each athlete invited to join Perform Training is evaluated based on 11 performance <strong>attributes</strong>
            key to any athlete’s success.
          </p>
          <p>
            From these attribute scores, the Perform Team creates a comprehensive performance profile, or what we call an athlete's
            <strong>archetype</strong>.
